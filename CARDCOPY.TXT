Emu48, when emulating a HP48, save the user, the port1 memory and other
information in one file (*.E48). But sometimes it's useful to import or to
export port1 data. CARDCOPY now allows you to import/export 32KB or 128KB card
files into/from the port1 memory of an Emu48 state file. The program can handle
HP48SX/GX state and 32/128KB card files (file size 64/256KB) as source or
destination. On all other file types you'll get an error. It's recommended to
switch off the emulated HP48 before importing port1 data into a state file. So
you're sure that the HP48 wasn't busy and, when you switch on the emulated
calculator, the changed card will be detected.

Remember: Don't import data when port1 is merged! This will corrupt memory.
Second, when you import data, all files that are saved in port1 are purged.

The syntax is: CARDCOPY <Sourcefile> <Destinationfile>

Some examples:

- SX.E48       , an Emu48 state file for a HP48SX
- GX.E48       , an Emu48 state file for a HP48GX
- RPLTOOLS.BIN , a 128KB port2 file

If you want to
- export the port1 content of SX.E48 to RPLTOOLS.BIN then type
  CARDCOPY SX.E48 RPLTOOLS.BIN
- import the RPLTOOLS.BIN as port1 into GX.E48 then type
  CARDCOPY RPLTOOLS.BIN GX.E48
- export the port1 content of SX.E48 to GX.48 then type
  CARDCOPY SX.E48 GX.E48
