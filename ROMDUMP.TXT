	* ROMDump Wizard V1.2 *
	***********************

The ROMDump Wizard has been written to allow you to quickly dump the ROM from
your HP48. The process is entirely automated and can be interrupted at any time.
This program is a rewritten version of the ROMDump Wizard from Sebastien
Carlier. The download engine has changed and is now based on Jean-Yves Avenard's
great ROMUPL program. If you have trouble with the Wizard, please use the
original ROMUPL program instead. It's included with permission of Jean-Yves
Avenard in this archive as well.

My ROM copy times:
SX: 00:06:08 (OS: NT4.0 SP3)
GX: 00:11:19 (OS: NT4.0 SP3)

In Step 2 you are asked for the "ROM format". Choose "x48/raw" for all-purpose
use and "Emu48" if you want to use the ROM dump for the Emu48 emulator (Win32
version). You can also use the CONVERT utility to convert "x48/raw" ROM dumps
into the Emu48 format. After downloading you will find the ROM file in the
directory of the ROMDUMP.EXE utility.

In the "x48/raw" mode the file has the name 48SX_?.ROM or 48GX_?.ROM. The ? in
the name is a placeholder for the character of the ROM version you have. In the
"Emu48" mode the file has the name ROM.48S or ROM.48G; this depends on the
calculator you have. Be sure that there is no older file with the used names in
this directory before using!

I added the file ROM2DMP.EXE to generate a DMP file from a "x48/raw" file. This
format is generated by the integrated memory scanner in the HP48 S series or by
the ROMDUMP utility from Eddie C. Dost. It's used for example by Derek S.
Nickel's Voyager (one of the first unassembler / decompiler).
