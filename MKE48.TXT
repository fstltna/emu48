Emu48 can only generate a HP48SX with 32KB system or a HP48GX with 128KB system
RAM both with 128KB port1 RAM. It isn't for example possible to generate a HP48G
with 32KB system and no port1 RAM. Emulating a HP48G is only interesting for
test purpose, so this type isn't selectable in Emu48. MKE48 now create a Emu48
state file with the given memory capabilities with one restriction. The state
file has no control on the port2 file, this is part of Emu48. So if you want to
emulate a HP48 with no port2 memory you have to disable port2 in Emu48. Refer to
Emu48.txt, especially to the COMMAND LINE section please.

The syntax is: MKE48 <E48-File> <Model[S|G]> <Port0-Size> <Port1-Size>

where
- <E48-File> is the state file name to create
- <Model[S|G]> is the calculator model (S for S(X), G for G(X))
- <Port0-Size> is the size of system memory in KB
- <Port1-Size> is the size of port1 memory in KB

There's no parameter check, so you have to know what you do.

If you want to
- create a HP48G state file with the name HP48G.E48 then type
  MKE48 HP48G.E48 G 32 0
- start the emulator with the state file HP48G.E48 and no port2 RAM then type
  EMU48 HP48G.E48 ""

Of course I never start Emu48 from the command line, I usually add the command
line arguments to a Windows link. After starting the emulator you're asked for a
KML script that should be used with the state file.
